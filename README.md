| 3.5         | Sorting feature   | The component highlighted the props passed in and I installed a dependency PropTypes from React. This allowed me to specify the props for the button component. The component functioned without this but I added it so that the red error lines would go away. This also makes this component reusable and checks that it only takes those types of props - can help prevent errors.                                                                                                                                           |
|             | React Router      | Really struggled to get react router to function properly because I did not implement it from the start. There was a lot to change all at once and i had a hard time with finding/understanding the bugs. I had to change the way children components got data via useParamas rather than using props. This took me ages to figure out.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3.20 & 3.39 | Favorites         | The setFavorites functionality was very hard to implement. I had to create a unique id so that i could compare it to existing episode ids, in order to know if something is already added to localstorage or not losts of bugs and trouble shooting. The unique ids also serves the to prevent clashing data if there are episodes with same names accross different seasons and shows.                                                                                                                                         |

|             | Audio Player      | I can get the audio player to play the episode clicked on but struggling to reset it when a different episode is clicked. I didnt want to create a store or a bigger context state because I dont really have the confidence so I had to drill props to make the audio player work. For now the user can click an episode the handleEpisodePLay is called in the SHowEpisodes and it passes the data up the the App parent where currentEpisode state changes and its then passed to the MusicPLayer component that handles it. |
|             | Audio Player      | Im having difficulty resetting the audio player when moving to a new episode. Right now the new episode is playing but it continues where the other left off (problem is likely due to the auidio file being the same)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
